      description: "Developed an Arabic NLP model that predicts the next word in a sentence using a custom-trained dataset from Algerian history books. The pipeline included text extraction from PDFs (via PyPDF2/PdfReader), advanced tokenization with Stanza and NLTK, and preprocessing steps like stopword removal, lemmatization, and NER tagging. The model analyzes character/word matrices and contextual patterns to generate accurate predictions, with a user-friendly interface for phrase generation.",
